    		A Game of Monopoly With the Woman Who Wrote the Book on It

                Playing Monopoly—which so often begins with cheerful ambition and devolves, after weary hours, into a sighing slog toward a lonely end—seems not entirely unlike writing a book. Time stretches on, the table gets cluttered. The writer Mary Pilon has become an expert in moving things along. If you play by the official rules, she insists, Monopoly need not last more than an hour and a half. On a recent afternoon, she set up the board in her Brooklyn apartment, in the spot where, not long before, she had finished writing a book called “The Monopolists.”

                “Psychologically, it’s a weird game,” she said. Pilon, who is twenty-eight, has short blond hair, and wore a polka dot skirt. “When people say they hate Monopoly, it’s because they lose so bad. They lose their assets. It’s hard to reverse negative momentum. With Clue, if you make the wrong guess, that’s it—there isn’t any prolonged, painful bleeding.” She shrugged. “I’ve become a Monopoly dictator. Like with Free Parking, I’ll just say it’s not in the rules, because I don’t want to be here all night. I guess I’m just bringing it back to the Quakers, because that’s how they played.”

                Her book, which came out last week, traces Monopoly’s origin to a stenographer-poet named Elizabeth Magie, who patented what she called “The Landlord’s Game” in 1904. Magie made two sets of rules: a monopolist version, which rewarded crushing your opponents to amass riches, and an anti-monopolist version, in which everybody benefitted from the creation of wealth. This early design got passed around and altered, and variations dispersed throughout the country, eventually making their way to Atlantic City’s Quakers, who gave the game its local color. By the time Parker Brothers got hold of it, a tradition of ignoring the rules had been well established.
